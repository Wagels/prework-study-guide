# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

- My motivation for making this webpage came from the large amount of information given to me at once. I needed a place to store what I have learned in an easily accessable place.
- I wanted to compile all of the information I have about coding and web developement in one place.
- This solves the problem of forgetting key factors about HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and other languages because I can always refer back to this website.
- I learned a lot while building this. Such as how to use Git and Gitbash, and how to code with Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
